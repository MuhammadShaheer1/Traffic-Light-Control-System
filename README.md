# Traffic-Light-Control-System

## Objectives

Objectives of this project inlcuded

• Implement a traffic light ladder program using counter, move and equal instructions. 

• Create a second traffic light ladder program using sequencer instructions. 

## Our Work

This project involved designing a traffic light control system. We first operated the traffic light 
system by using instructions like move (MOV), counter (CTU) and equal (EQU). We set the 
binary values in these instructions in order to operate the system according to the requirement. 
This ladder program consists of eight rungs. Then in order to simplify the program we used 
only one instruction named sequencer operator (SQO) which can perform the operations of all 
these instructions. Then by using the state table, we were able to develop a set of Boolean 
equations that could be used to program the system and the ladder program now consists of 
only three rungs.
